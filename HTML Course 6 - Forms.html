<!--
The <form> Element

HTML forms are used to collect information from the user.
Forms are defined using the <form> element, with its opening and closing tags: -->
<html>
<body>
   <form>This is a form element.
     <input type="text" name="username" /><br />
  <input type="password" name="password" />
</form>
</body>

<!-- Use the action attribute to point to a webpage that will load after the user submits the form.
NOTE: Needs a submit button for this action to take place!!!

After the form is submitted, the data should be processed on the server using a programming language, such as PHP.
-->
<form action="http://www.sololearn.com"> This is a form element with an action attribute.
  <input type="text" name="username" /><br />
  <input type="password" name="password" />
  <input type="submit"/>
</form>

<!-- Usually the form is submitted to a web page on a web server. -->

<!-- The method attribute specifies the HTTP method (GET or POST) to be used when forms are submitted (see below for description):
<form action="url" method="GET">

<form action="url" method="POST">

When you use GET, the form data will be visible in the page address.

Use POST if the form is updating data, or includes sensitive information (passwords).
POST offers better security because the submitted data is not visible in the page address. -->


<!-- If we change the input type to radio, it allows the user select only one of a number of choices: -->
<input type="radio" name="gender" value="male" /> Male <br />
<input type="radio" name="gender" value="female" /> Female <br />

<br /><br /><br />
<!-- The type "checkbox" allows the user to select more than one option: -->
<input type="checkbox" name="gender" value="1" /> Sandals <br />
<input type="checkbox" name="gender" value="2" /> Sunglasses <br />
<input type="checkbox" name="gender" value="2" /> Sunscreen <br />
<input type="checkbox" name="gender" value="2" /> Hat <br />


<!-- CONTACT ME FORM! -->
<h1><span>Contact Me</span></h1>
<form>
  <input name="name" type="text" /><br/>
  <input name="email" type="text" /><br/>
  <textarea name="message"></textarea>
  <input type="submit" value="SEND" class="submit" />
</form>

<!-- This is just a static HTML page, so it won't work to actually submit the form.
You'd need to create the server-side code in order to submit a real form and process the data.
