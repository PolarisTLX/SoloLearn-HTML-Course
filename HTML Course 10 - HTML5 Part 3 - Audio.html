<audio> in HTML5

There are two different ways to specify the audio source file's URL. The first uses the source attribute: -->
<audio src="European_Dragon_Roaring_and_breathe_fire-daniel-simon.mp3" controls>
   Audio element not supported by your browser
</audio>
<!-- The text between the <audio> and </audio> tags will display in browsers that do not support the <audio> element. -->


<!-- The second way uses the <source> element inside the <audio> element: -->
<audio controls>
   <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
   <source src="audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
</audio>

<!-- Multiple <source> elements can be linked to different audio files. The browser will use the first recognized format. -->






Attributes of <audio>

controls
Specifies that audio controls should be displayed (such as a play/pause button, etc.)

autoplay
When this attribute is defined, audio starts playing as soon as it is ready, without asking for the visitor's permission.
<audio controls autoplay>
Try It Yourself

loop
This attribute is used to have the audio replay every time it is finished.
<audio controls autoplay loop>
Try It Yourself

Currently, there are three supported file formats for the <audio> element: MP3, WAV, and OGG.


  <!--
  Videos in HTML

  The video element is similar to the audio element.
  You can specify the video source URL using an attribute in a video element, or using source elements inside the video element:-->


  <video>   <!-- <video controls> -->
     <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
     <source src="video.ogg" type="video/ogg">
     Video is not supported by your browser
  </video>

  <!--
  Another aspect that the audio and video elements have in common,
  is that the major browsers do not all support the same file types.
  If the browser does not support the first video type, it will try the next one. -->

  <!-- Currently, there are three supported video formats for the <video> element: MP4, WebM, and OGG. -->
