HTML5

When writing HTML5 documents, one of the first new features that you'll notice is the doc type declaration:
<!DOCTYPE HTML>

The character encoding (charset) declaration is also simplified:
<meta charset="UTF-8">

New Elements in HTML5
<article>, <aside>, <audio>, <canvas>, <datalist>, <details>, <embed>, <footer>, <header>, <nav>, <output>, <progress>, <section>, <video>, and even more!
The default character encoding in HTML5 is UTF-8.
