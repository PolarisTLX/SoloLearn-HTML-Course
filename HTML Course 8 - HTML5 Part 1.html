HTML5

When writing HTML5 documents, one of the first new features that you'll notice is the doc type declaration:
<!DOCTYPE HTML>

<body>

<!-- The character encoding (charset) declaration is also simplified:
<meta charset="UTF-8">

New Elements in HTML5
<article>, <aside>, <audio>, <canvas>, <datalist>, <details>, <embed>, <footer>, <header>, <nav>, <output>, <progress>, <section>, <video>, and even more!
The default character encoding in HTML5 is UTF-8.

In HTML, elements typically belonged in either the block level or inline content model. HTML5 introduces seven main content models.

- Metadata
- Embedded
- Interactive
- Heading
- Phrasing
- Flow
- Sectioning
The HTML5 content models are designed to make the markup structure more meaningful for both the browser and the web designer.


Content Models

Metadata: Content that sets up the presentation or behavior of the rest of the content. These elements are found in the head of the document.
Elements: <base>, <link>, <meta>, <noscript>, <script>, <style>, <title>

Embedded: Content that imports other resources into the document.
Elements: <audio>, <video>, <canvas>, <iframe>, <img>, <math>, <object>, <svg>

Interactive: Content specifically intended for user interaction.
Elements: <a>, <audio>, <video>, <button>, <details>, <embed>, <iframe>, <img>, <input>, <label>, <object>, <select>, <textarea>

Heading: Defines a section header.
Elements: <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>, <hgroup>

Phrasing: This model has a number of inline level elements in common with HTML4.
Elements: <img>, <span>, <strong>, <label>, <br />, <small>, <sub>, and more.

The same element can belong to more than one content model. -->

<br/>
<a href="https://api.sololearn.com/DownloadFile?id=2471">A generic HTML5 page structure looks like this:</a>


<!-- Note that the <header> is completely different from the <head> tag. -->

<!--
The <article> Element -->

<!-- Article is a self-contained, independent piece of content that can be used and distributed separately from the rest of the page or site.
This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent piece of content.  -->

<!-- The <article> element replaces the <div> element that was widely used in HTML4, along with an id or class. -->
<article>
   <h1>The article title</h1>
   <p>Contents of the article element </p>
</article>

<!--
The <section> Element

<section> is a logical container of the page or article.
Sections can be used to divide up content within an article.
For example, a homepage could have a section for introducing the company, another for news items, and still another for contact information.

Each <section> should be identified, typically by including a heading (h1-h6 element) as a child of the <section> element. -->
<article>
   <h1>Welcome</h1>
   <section>
      <h1>Heading</h1>
      <p>content or image</p>
   </section>
</article>


<!-- If it makes sense to separately syndicate the content of a <section> element, use an <article> element instead. -->

<!--
The <aside> Element

<aside> is secondary or tangential content which could be considered separate from but indirectly related to the main content.
This type of content is often represented in sidebars.
When an <aside> tag is used within an <article> tag, the content of the <aside> should be specifically related to that article. -->
<article>
   <h1> Gifts for everyone </h1>
   <p> This website will be the best place for choosing gifts </p>
   <aside>
      <p> Gifts will be delivered to you within 24 hours </p>
   </aside>
</article>



<!--
<audio> in HTML5

There are two different ways to specify the audio source file's URL. The first uses the source attribute: -->
<audio src="European_Dragon_Roaring_and_breathe_fire-daniel-simon.mp3" controls>
   Audio element not supported by your browser
</audio>
<!-- The text between the <audio> and </audio> tags will display in browsers that do not support the <audio> element. -->


<!-- The second way uses the <source> element inside the <audio> element: -->
<audio controls>
   <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
   <source src="audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
</audio>

<!-- Multiple <source> elements can be linked to different audio files. The browser will use the first recognized format. -->
