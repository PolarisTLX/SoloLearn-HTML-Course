HTML5 Web Storage

With HTML5 web storage, websites can store data on a user's local computer.
Before HTML5, we had to use JavaScript cookies to achieve this functionality.

The Advantages of Web Storage
- More secure
- Faster
- Stores a larger amount of data
- Stored data is not sent with every server request
Local storage is per domain. All pages from one domain can store and access the same data.

There are two types of web storage objects:
- sessionStorage()
- localStorage()

Local vs. Session
- Session Storage is destroyed once the user closes the browser
- Local Storage stores data with no expiration date
You need to be familiar with basic JavaScript in order to understand and use the API.


Working with Values

The syntax for web storage for both local and session storage is very simple and similar.
The data is stored as key/value pairs.

Storing a Value:
localStorage.setItem("key1", "value1");

Getting a Value:
//this will print the value
alert(localStorage.getItem("key1"));

Removing a Value:
localStorage.removeItem("key1");

Removing All Values:
localStorage.clear();

The same syntax applies to the session storage, with one difference: Instead of localStorage, sessionStorage is used.

Using HTML Geolocation

The Geolocation APIâ€™s main method is getCurrentPosition, which retrieves the current geographic location of the user's device.
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition();

Parameters:
showLocation (mandatory): Defines the callback method that retrieves location information.
ErrorHandler(optional): Defines the callback method that is invoked when an error occurs in processing the asynchronous call.
Options (optional): Defines a set of options for retrieving the location information.
You need to be familiar with basic JavaScript in order to understand and use the API.

User location can be presented in two ways: Geodetic and Civic.

1. The geodetic way to describe position refers directly to latitude and longitude.
2. The civic representation of location data is presented in a format that is more easily read and understood by the average person.
