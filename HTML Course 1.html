<!-- The head of an HTML file contains all of the non-visual elements that help make the page work. -->

<!-- To place a title on the tab describing the web page, add a <title> element to your head section:
The title element is important because it describes the page and is used by search engines. -->

<!-- The <body> tag follows the head tag.
All visual-structural elements are contained within the body tag.
Headings, paragraphs, lists, quotes, images, and links are just a few of the elements that can be contained within the body tag. -->

    HTML Attributes: Attributes provide additional information about an element or a tag, while also modifying them.
    Most attributes have a value; the value modifies the attribute.
    Attributes are always specified in the start tag, and they appear in name="value" pairs.-->

<p align="center">
   This text is aligned to center with attribute &ltp align="center"&gt.
</p>

<!-- We can modify the horizontal line so it has a width of 50 pixels using the width attribute: -->
<hr width="50px" />
<!-- An element's width can also be defined using percentages: -->
<hr width="50%" />
<br/>
<p align="center">Below is a horizontal line with attributes of width="10%" and align="left"<br />
   <hr width="10%" align="left" /> This is also a text.
</p>

<p align="center">contradictory attributes within the same element.
   <hr width="50%" align="left" />

   </body>
</html>

<!-- horizontal lines are created using <hr /> tags. -->

<!--
Browsers display <strong> as <b>, and <em> as <i>.
However, the meanings of these tags differ:
<b> and <i> define bold and italic text, respectively,
while <strong> and <em> indicate that the text is "important". -->


<!--
HTML includes six levels of headings, which are ranked according to importance.
These are <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, and <h6>.

  <body>
     <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
     <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
     <h3>This is heading 3</h3>

It is not recommended that you use headings just to make the text big or bold,
because search engines use headings to index the web page structure and content. -->
