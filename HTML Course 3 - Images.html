<!-- The <img> Tag -->

<html>
   <head>
      <title>first page</title>
   </head>
   <body>

<!-- The <img> tag is used to insert an image. It contains only attributes, and does not have a closing tag.
The image's URL (address) can be defined using the src attribute. -->

<img src="image.jpg" />


<!-- if you have a photo named "tree.jpg" in the same folder as the HTML file,
your code should look like this: -->
<img src="tree.jpg" alt="" />
<!-- In case the image cannot be displayed, the alt attribute specifies an alternate text
that describes the image in words.
The alt attribute is required.  (for this? otherwise not required?) -->


<!--
Image Resizing

To define the image size, use the width and height attributes.
The value can be specified in pixels or as a percentage: -->

<img src="tree.jpg" height="150px" width="150px" alt="" />
      <!-- or -->
<img src="tree.jpg" height="50%" width="50%" alt="" />

<!-- NOTE: Loading images takes time. Using large images can slow down your page, so use them with care. -->

<!-- By default, an image has no borders. The border attribute within the image tag can be used to create a border around the image. -->
<img src="tree.jpg" height="150px" width="150px" border="1px" alt="" />


<!--
LINKS: The <a> Tag

You can add links to text or images that the user can click on to be directed to another file or webpage.
Links are defined using the <a> tag.

Use the href attribute to define the link's destination address:

<a href=""></a>

Remember: Anchor Tag  + Hyperlink Reference  for   <a href=""></a>

<a href="http://www.sololearn.com"> Learn Playing </a>
-->

<!--
The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.
Giving a _blank value to your attribute will have the link open in a new window or new tab:
<a href="http://www.sololearn.com" target="_blank">
   Learn Playing
</a> -->
