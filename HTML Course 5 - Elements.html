Types of Elements

In HTML, elements are either BLOCK LEVEL or INLINE elements.

Block level elements start from a new line.
For example: <h1>, <form>, <li>, <ol>, <ul>, <p>, <pre>, <table>, <div>, etc.

Inline elements are normally displayed without line breaks.
For example: <b>, <a>, <strong>, <img>, <input>, <em>, <span>, etc.

The <div> element defines a block-level section in a document.
The <span> element defines an inline section in a document.

You can insert inline elements inside block elements.
For example, you can have multiple <span> elements inside a <div> element.
BUT
Inline elements CANNOT contain any block level elements!


The <div> element is a block-level element that is often used as a container for other HTML elements.
When used together with some CSS styling, the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content: -->
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Headline</h1>
    <div style="background-color:green; color:white; padding:20px;">
      <p>Some paragraph text goes here.</p>
      <p>Another paragraph goes here.</p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>



<!-- Other elements can be used either as block level elements or inline elements. This includes the following elements:
APPLET - embedded Java applet
IFRAME - Inline frame
INS - inserted text
MAP - image map
OBJECT - embedded object
SCRIPT - script within an HTML document -->
